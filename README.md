# Ay up

I am oZe Linguica aka StrangeCloud and I want to make video games. I have been studying C# and GDScript since the beginning of 2023 and I'd like to think I've learned a lot.

I find programming very rewarding and a good way to express oneself creatively. At the same time, I get frustrated easily while coding.

I will not be collaborating with anyone at this time.
